# Proprietary Probability Map for Dynamic Corporate Credit Analysis

This project aims to develop a proof of concept for a proprietary credit risk system based on the concepts outlined in the provided design document. The system visualizes and quantifies corporate credit risk across a continuous spectrum using advanced data structures and machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- \`src/\`: Contains all source code for the system.
  - \`api/\`: FastAPI application for exposing system functionalities.
  - \`core/\`: Core components like configuration management, logging, and utilities.
  - \`data_management/\`: Modules for ontology, knowledge base, and knowledge graph.
  - \`mlops/\`: Scripts and modules for MLOps practices (model registry, monitoring).
  - \`risk_map/\`: Components for generating and managing the risk rating map.
  - \`risk_models/\`: Credit risk models (PD, LGD, Pricing).
  - \`simulation/\`: Modules for scenario analysis and stress testing.
- \`data/\`: For sample data, schemas, and other data artifacts. (Note: The Vega DB is an external system).
- \`notebooks/\`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model prototyping, and demonstrations.
- \`tests/\`: Unit and integration tests for the system.
- \`requirements.txt\`: Python dependencies for the project.
- \`.env.example\`: Example environment variables. Copy to \`.env\` and customize.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Create a Python virtual environment: \`python -m venv venv\`
3.  Activate the virtual environment: \`source venv/bin/activate\` (on Unix/macOS) or \`venv\Scripts\activate\` (on Windows).
4.  Install dependencies: \`pip install -r requirements.txt\`
5.  Copy \`.env.example\` to \`.env\` and update any necessary environment variables.

## Running the System (Example for API)

(Instructions to be added as components are developed, e.g., how to run the FastAPI server)
