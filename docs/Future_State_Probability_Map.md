# Future State: Proprietary Credit Risk Probability Map

This document outlines the envisioned future state for the Proprietary Credit Risk Probability Map, emphasizing advanced analytical integrations and a richer understanding of interconnected credit risk. This serves as a conceptual blueprint for further development.

## I. Vision for the Probability Map

The Probability Map aims to be a dynamic, multi-dimensional system offering deep insights into portfolio risk, moving beyond simple PD and LGD point estimates.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Multi-Dimensionality:**
    *   Incorporate not just PD, LGD, and Expected Loss (EL), but also:
        *   **Risk-Adjusted Return metrics.**
        *   **Concentration Indices:** By industry, geography, single obligor, and interconnected counterparty groups (derived from the Knowledge Graph).
        *   **Qualitative Overlays:** Systematically integrate scores for management quality, regulatory risk, ESG factors (if data becomes available).
        *   **Uncertainty Metrics:** Represent PD/LGD as distributions rather than point estimates (e.g., via Bayesian modeling outputs).
        *   **Network Metrics:** KG-derived scores for systemic importance, contagion risk, or vulnerability due to supply chain disruptions.
*   **Dynamic & Interactive Visualization (Conceptual):**
    *   While UI is out of scope for current PoC, the data generated should support:
        *   Heatmaps showing risk concentrations across sectors/countries.
        *   Network graphs illustrating interconnected risks and potential contagion paths.
        *   Drill-downs from portfolio level to obligor level, showing detailed risk drivers.
        *   Time-series views of risk evolution for segments or individual entities.
*   **What-If Analysis & Scenario Simulation:**
    *   Allow users to define complex scenarios (beyond simple feature shocks) and see their impact on the entire probability map.
    *   Simulate the effect of policy changes (e.g., tightening lending criteria for a sector).
*   **Real-World Economic Linkage:**
    *   The map should aim to reflect and provide insights into the current and projected state of the real-world economy and credit cycles by integrating macroeconomic forecasts and external event data.

## II. Advanced Analytical Integrations (Conceptual)

To achieve this vision, several advanced analytical techniques are proposed:

### 1. Bayesian Networks for PD/LGD Modeling
*   **Concept:** Model PD and LGD using Bayesian Networks (BNs) that capture causal relationships between macroeconomic variables (e.g., GDP growth, unemployment, sector-specific indices), company financials (both reported and projected), and Knowledge Graph-derived metrics (e.g., supplier/customer dependency scores, centrality).
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Uncertainty Quantification:** BNs naturally produce probability distributions for PD/LGD, providing a richer understanding of risk than point estimates.
    *   **Expert Knowledge Integration:** Allow incorporation of expert opinions and domain knowledge alongside data-driven insights.
    *   **Scenario Analysis:** More intuitive way to see how shocks to input variables (e.g., a drop in GDP) propagate through the network to affect PD/LGD.
*   **Developer Notes:** Requires specialized libraries (e.g., `pgmpy`, `stan`, `pymc`). Data requirements include historical time series for macroeconomic factors and well-structured company/loan data.

### 2. "Random Dark Forest" Scenarios (Sophisticated Stress Testing)
*   **Concept:** Move beyond simple, isolated feature shocks. Generate complex, systemic stress scenarios by:
    *   Modeling interdependencies using the Knowledge Graph (e.g., if a key industrial company defaults, what's the cascading impact on its suppliers and their suppliers, or its customers?).
    *   Introducing "unknown unknowns" or "black swan" event simulations by applying unexpected, high-impact shocks to less obvious parts of the network or by combining multiple, seemingly unrelated moderate shocks that have a severe compound effect.
    *   This involves graph traversal algorithms, agent-based modeling concepts, and potentially reinforcement learning to discover unexpected vulnerabilities.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   More realistic assessment of portfolio resilience to systemic shocks and contagion.
    *   Identification of hidden vulnerabilities and second/third-order effects.
*   **Developer Notes:** Computationally intensive. Requires a robust and richly populated Knowledge Graph. Simulation outputs would need careful summarization to be actionable.

### 3. Orthogonal Feature Engineering
*   **Concept:** Develop techniques to transform raw features into a new set of more potent, less correlated (orthogonal) features for the core ML models (PD, LGD).
    *   **Methods:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and de-correlation. Autoencoders (especially for non-linear transformations). Factor analysis.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improved model performance and stability by reducing multicollinearity.
    *   Potentially more interpretable underlying risk factors if factors can be named or understood.
    *   Can help in handling high-dimensional feature spaces.
*   **Developer Notes:** Requires careful validation to ensure transformed features don't lose critical information. Interpretability of PCA/autoencoder-derived features can be challenging.

### 4. Semantic Analysis of Qualitative Data
*   **Concept:** Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques if textual data becomes available:
    *   **Default Event Reasons:** Analyze `DefaultEvent.reason` text to automatically categorize default drivers more granularly (e.g., distinguishing between fraud, mismanagement, market downturn).
    *   **News Feeds/Analyst Reports (External Data):** Process financial news, industry reports, or earnings call transcripts related to companies in the portfolio to extract sentiment, emerging risks, or early warning signals.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Enriches quantitative models with qualitative insights.
    *   Provides early warnings that might not yet be reflected in financial statements.
    *   Better understanding of *why* defaults occur.
*   **Developer Notes:** Requires NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers). Sentiment analysis and topic modeling can be complex to tune for financial contexts.

### 5. Advanced External Data Integration
*   **Concept:** Integrate a wider array of external datasets beyond simple market data points.
    *   **Macroeconomic Forecasts:** From reputable sources (e.g., IMF, World Bank, central banks, private providers).
    *   **Market Sentiment Indicators:** VIX, credit spread indices, consumer confidence.
    *   **Geopolitical Risk Scores.**
    *   **Alternative Data:** Supply chain disruption indices, shipping data, job posting trends for specific sectors/companies (if ethically sourced and relevant).
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Makes models more forward-looking and responsive to changing external environments.
    *   Improves scenario generation realism.
*   **Developer Notes:** Requires robust data ingestion pipelines, handling of different data frequencies and formats, and careful consideration of data licensing costs.

## III. Justification for Advanced Techniques

These advanced techniques are proposed because traditional credit risk modeling often relies on historical data and may not fully capture:
*   **Complex Interdependencies:** Risks rarely exist in isolation. KG and systemic scenarios address this.
*   **Uncertainty:** Point estimates for PD/LGD can be misleading. Bayesian methods offer a way to represent this.
*   **Qualitative Factors:** Purely quantitative models miss nuances. NLP and structured qualitative inputs can bridge this.
*   **Forward-Looking Risks:** Historical data is less useful in rapidly changing environments. Macro forecasts and alternative data help.

By integrating these, the Probability Map can evolve into a more predictive, resilient, and insightful decision-support tool.

## IV. Drawing Real-World Conclusions & Actionable Insights

The ultimate goal of this enhanced Probability Map is to:

*   **Identify Systemic Vulnerabilities:** Pinpoint which parts of the portfolio (or the broader economy it represents) are most vulnerable to specific types of shocks.
*   **Inform Capital Allocation & Risk Appetite:** Provide a clearer basis for setting risk limits and allocating capital more effectively.
*   **Proactive Risk Mitigation:** Offer earlier warnings and more specific insights to allow for proactive measures (e.g., hedging, reducing exposure to certain sectors/companies before a crisis hits).
*   **Strategic Decision Making:** Help understand the potential credit implications of major economic trends, policy changes, or geopolitical events, informing long-term strategy.
*   **Shape the Outlook:** By simulating various future paths and their credit risk consequences, the map can help form a more nuanced view of the economic outlook and potential "black swan" events.

## V. Developer Notes for Future Implementation

*   **Iterative Approach:** Implement these advanced features incrementally.
*   **Data Quality & Governance:** Advanced models are highly sensitive to data quality. Robust data validation, cleaning, and governance processes are paramount.
*   **Model Validation:** Develop specialized validation strategies for Bayesian models, KG-informed models, and NLP components. Backtesting complex scenarios will be challenging but necessary.
*   **Computational Resources:** Some of these techniques (Bayesian MCMC, large-scale graph algorithms, deep learning for NLP/autoencoders) will require significant computational resources.
*   **Explainability (XAI):** As models become more complex, maintaining transparency and explainability (e.g., via SHAP for tree models, LIME, or specific methods for BNs) will be crucial for user trust and regulatory compliance.
*   **Modularity:** Design components (e.g., KG service, scenario engine, specific model types) to be as modular as possible for easier maintenance and upgrades.
